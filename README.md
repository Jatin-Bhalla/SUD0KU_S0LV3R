# SUD0KU_S0LV3R
When you learn you can beat code with  your code! 

I will make 2 files  one with a sudoku solver and another with a sudoku game
the  console idk maybe I will use py game but honestly not into much of graphics and gaming also the shuffling algorithm and solving algorithm might be a bit 
time consuming to find and learn and make idk if i should create one but it honestly might just be a bit mouch 
yes i said mouch and i meant mouch think of it as an french way  but funny or german yeah well german way sounds mmcuh  funnier! LMAO
